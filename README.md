## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ebrahim. I've been enjoying programming since 2020, Most of my time was split between studying core CS topics such as OS, Databases, Compilers using both C and C++,
The other half of my time was spent on Web Development using JavaScript for back-end with node and front-end with react.

- My main focus currently is back-end Development and Databases.
- I have finished a [large project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2022/projects/WhAudlF6) successfully in [Google Summer of Code 2022](https://gist.github.com/ebrahim354/2b1f87ae240cbfb4d5f561b903cd7dab) when I was in college.
- Iâ€™m currently learning PHP
- I've just finished Studying Science at Al-Azhar University And I'm currently looking for a Job. If you are hiring let's talk.
